    "What is Numpy?\n",
    "NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package which provides a high-performance, homogenous, multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:\n",
    "\n",
    "a powerful N-dimensional array object\n",
    "sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n",
    "tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n",
    "useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\n",
    "Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n",
